hipchat-pandora
===============

Notify hipchat room with currently playing song from Pandora One windows desktop application

It works by reading the tooltip text from the tray icon.

To use it, open up MyApplicationContext.cs, add your hipchat API token, compile and run the executable.

It launches as a tray icon itself, so just right-click and hit Exit to quit.


NOTE: This code is a GIANT HACK that basically relies on some code snippets I cobbled together from the internet.
